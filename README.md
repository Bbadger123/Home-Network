# Home-Network
This will be a showcase of my studies, knowledge and competence of building my first home network.
Initiated learning of the CCNA Cisco course and learned the various network devices including, routers, switches, firewalls and end users.
I created a diagram of my first network using Cisco packet tracer.![First Network Image](https://github.com/Bbadger123/Home-Network/assets/161724367/65055bec-0845-4d9d-b86d-707c308d590d)
